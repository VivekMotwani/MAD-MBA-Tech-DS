Created a Weather App containing 2 main components:
  1. Login Page
  2. Weather details
  
For Login Authentication we are using SQLite. For Login Credentials a user gets two options:
  1. Sign in
  2. Sign up

Once creating an account a users get the display of the current Location, if he / she wants to see the weather of any other location, the user gets an option to so.
